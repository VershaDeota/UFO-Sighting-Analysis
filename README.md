# UFO-Sighting-Analysis

The goal of this project is to explore the UFO data across US states and to get some meaningful insights.

For this project we will be working with Kaggle's UFO Sightings dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings

Following questions will be answered-
* When and where do people see UFOs in California?
* What is the average length of UFO sightings across the U.S. states?
* Differences in the circumstances of UFO sightings across the U.S. states?

I have referred following links in order to complete this project:
